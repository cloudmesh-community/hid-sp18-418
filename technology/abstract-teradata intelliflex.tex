Teradata Intelliflex is an integrated environment for Data Warehouse 
functionalities which in its own way integrates some of the strategic and 
operational workload onto one Data warehouse. It is available on Intellicloud, 
which is a cloud offering of Teradata. Intelliflex can "independently 
scale nodes" enabling us to use nodes as required to manage the processing 
power and also "store data on multiple layers of solid state drives" with 
virtual storage as per our data requirements.

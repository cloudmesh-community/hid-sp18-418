## changing password of a headless raspberry pi

Gregor: description is unclear, missing parts, the sals as specifies
here would return the same value, thus password could be
cracked. needs more description

* unplug the raspberry pi cluster and remove the sd card from the slot
* insert the sd card into a computer, and make sure we should have root 
  access on that computer
* locate and edit the etc/shadow file on the sd card
* run the command `openssl passwd -1 -salt`
* we must find the line that starts with pi and replace the text
  between the first and second with the output from the above command 
  we had executed
* eject the sd card from the computer
* insert the sd card back into the pi cluster
* boot the raspberry pi
* ssh to log into raspberry pi and set up the password
